# bluesky-scheduler

A single page application to schedule posts on Bluesky. The app runs entirely in the browser and uses the [Bluesky API](https://blueskyweb.xyz/docs/api) to schedule posts.

The scheduled posts will be sent to Bluesky at the scheduled time as long as the tab is open and you have internet connection.
